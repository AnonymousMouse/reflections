How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    Limits my focus to only things that have changed. If it worked before, something
    is breaking the code.
    
    Breaks normal human way of reading what he/she thinks should be written and see
    what is actually written.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    Allow one to see how the file came to be.
    
    Trace the thought processes and dead ends that lead to the current organization.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Pro: when the change is saved, the author records what the change was meant to do.
    Pro: easier to walk through many versions and compare.
    Pro: files that were changed to achieve one goal can be saved under a single record.
    
    Cons: must use proprietary tools provided by Google.
    Cons: no offline support for backups.
    Cons: easy to forget to save changes.
    Cons: if data is lost locally between start of changes and commiting changes, those 
    changes are lost.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Often in code and in linked files, changing one file forces another file to change
    as well. Saving individual files makes it hard to track down all the changes 
    needed to support a new file.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    FC on Win; diff on Unix/Mac/Linux.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    One can go back to a working system if something gets broken.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    Tracking projects and sharing projects.
